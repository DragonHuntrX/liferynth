Game Ideas
Timer runs at the beginning of the game, and you have a certain amount of time to move blocks before the simulation starts.

You have to move blocks to make one or many of the blocks 'alive' by the end of a certain number of cycles.

Game ides:
Indicator of the rules in each level somewhere on screen
Rules change across levels to affect the difficulty of different problems.
Player can be a part of life
Walls where player canâ€™t push blocks, but they can move once simulation starts
Maybe a timer
